## Problem Title
SIH 1653:Farmers’ Market Connect – Connecting Farmers Directly to Buyers
## Problem Description
Background:
Farmers often face challenges in selling their products at fair prices due to middlemen, lack of direct market access, price fluctuations, and logistical issues. Many small-scale farmers do not have the resources or digital infrastructure to connect with potential buyers directly, leading to financial losses and food wastage. On the other hand, consumers and businesses struggle to source fresh, locally grown, and reasonably priced produce without intermediaries inflating costs.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Agriculture

## Idea
Features & Functionality

1. Farmer Registration – Farmers can create profiles, list available crops, and set their own prices.
2. Buyer Marketplace – Consumers, vendors, and businesses can browse available products and place orders.
3. Live Price Dashboard – Farmers can see real-time market prices and adjust their pricing accordingly.
4. Smart Logistics & Delivery Partnering – Option for farmers to partner with local transporters for delivery.
5. Seasonal Crop Alerts – Buyers get notifications about seasonal fruits/vegetables directly from farmers.
6. AI-Based Demand Prediction – The platform suggests what crops farmers should grow based on demand trends.
7. Government Schemes & Subsidies Info – Farmers get updates on available government schemes and financial assistance.
8. Multi-Language & Voice Assistant – Farmers can access the platform in their native languages and use voice-based commands to list products or check updates.
   



## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The solution is a web and mobile-based marketplace that enables direct transactions between farmers and buyers (individual consumers, retailers, restaurants, and wholesalers). It includes real-time price discovery, AI-driven demand forecasting, secure payment systems, and logistics integration to ensure smooth operations.
